                Simulating physics on 2D balls

            <p>
                Physics was always my favorite science, although like all the other sciences, I was never too fond of
                the experimental part of gaining knowledge. However, physics is quite beautiful for creating models
                which we can then use.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, building an engine, like with anything in computing that taps into geometry, one quickly learns
                that it is much messier than the simplicity of equations would lead people on to believe. Torque and
                bound become much more annoying once they are no longer applied to perfect sticks and perfect balls. A
                falling square, while in equations can be simplified down to a point like particle, becomes complicated
                rather quickly, especially as one adds to
                it a rough and uneven terrain.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thus, in this engine, we only look at two types of objects and their interactions between each other.
                Lines, which are
                not movable and balls, which then bounce around and roll around as balls do. Needless to say, both of
                which is in 2D.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Okay, as always, we will start by creating two objects. <code>Ball</code> and <code>Line</code>. </p>
            <p>
                The <code>Ball</code> object will take as construction arguments its position, given in x and y
                coordinates, as well as its velocity, which will be given in the horizontal and vertical components.
                Globally, let us also declare a few variables which will determine and set the way the balls behave.
            <ul>
                <li>gravitational_constant </li>
                <li>ball_to_line_bounce</li>
                <li>ground_friction</li>
                <li>air_friction</li>
                <li>ball_to_ball_bounce</li>
            </ul>

            Of course, if you were to write these by yourself, it might be smart to shorten the names as to avoid
            unnecessarily long code.
            To be able to distinguish between them, I also gave each one a number.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>Line</code> object takes as input two sets of coordinates, which are the bounding points of
                the line. For simplicity sake, let us also give this a number, as the differentiator.
            </p>

            <p>
                Then, let us put all the lines and balls into a single array called <code>elements</code> through which,
                we iterate on every frame and call the show functions f it is a ball or a line and the update function
                if it is a ball only. The show function just calls on p5.js to draw a line or a circle at the correct
                place.
            </p>

            <p>
                The update function is 250 lines long and thus, going through it line by line would result in a way too
                long blog post. I tried to make the code readable. In short, it checks if it hit a line or a different
                ball. If it is a line, it takes two components of its velocity, one parallel and one perpendicular and
                invert the perpendicular one and multiplies it with the bound fraction while just multiplying the
                parallel one with the friction one. The hardest part, I still remember, is to prevent both clipping of
                the ball a bit too low or a bit too high, causing it to bounce if it slides. Best do it with just slowly
                inching towards the line. If it is a ball, then make a new vector out of the difference of the two
                positions. If the length is small enough to cause a hit, then take that vector, we slowly inch the ball
                towards the other, until they are touching, then to the vector of the difference, we make a parallel and
                perpendicular components of the balls velocity, calculate the bounce back it will receive and the change
                of direction, after which we call the update function on the ball we had hit with the argument the
                acceleration it had just received from this ball.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know this was not explained super well, but I tried writing it out but after about 1000th word, I
                realized I was backing the wrong horse, so just have fun with it. (also, some variables have Slovene
                names, most notably vzporedno = parallel and pravokotno = perpendicular, but other than that, I think
                all is English. Using these vague instructions and the code, I think it should be clear, as I know that
                without the at least a bit of an idea of what I was doing, the code is very unclear)
            </p>
            <p>
                To that, just add then the ability to add elements into the array with the mouse and you should be done.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                If you are planning on trying to create this yourself, just try to have very clean code. All joking
                aside, my code is relatively clean, and this is very important when the update function need so much
                mathematics and so many variables. Also, look up these articles:
            <ul>
                <li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line–line_intersection> Line–line intersection</a></li>

            </ul>
            Not that I read these while working but they are most useful if you get a bit lost, especially the first
            one, which is basically the explanation of the checking for collision between balls and lines.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Maybe there is an easier way to do all of this that does not take such a disgustingly long time to
                write, however, as I did not look at how people built these but made it myself knowing only the physics
                from high school, I wouldn't know.
