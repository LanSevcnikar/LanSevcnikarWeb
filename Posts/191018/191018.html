            </h1>
            <p>
                Why? I have no idea. I had the idea to make a matching app a while ago, as I was not happy with what was
                present at the school. How would it work? People would log in through their II. gimnazija Maribor mail,
                to ensure only students would be present.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started off by building a simple basic webpage. Two main home pages, logged in and logged out, about
                and help page. It was just to have a simple layout of the website so that a basic system could be then
                set up.
            </p>
            <p>
                I added then logging in. Using Firebase's authentication, I first wanted everyone to make an account but
                then I realized it would be much simpler if I were just limit the ability to log in through Gmail auth
                2.0. Then I of course made the logged in and logged out webpages to link to each other depending on the
                state of the user <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth">[link]</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Users then had to be given the ability to write their crushes' emails. I made a simple JavaScript
                function to ensure that all email would end in @druga.si and I could already add them to the Firebase
                database. Each person had a designated field, with an array of strings called "crushes", in which the
                mails would be saved. <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore">[link]</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The next thing was the actual matching algorithm. Very simple stuff once more. Using firebase functions,
                the <code>onChange()</code> function was called any time anything was updated in the firebase. Whenever
                anyone updated their list of crushes, it would look through the list, see which names had been added and
                for all the new names, it would look through all the crushes of that person. If the person who had made
                the first change was then found in the array of the crush, that was to be a match <a
                    href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions">[link]</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the match was found, the next step was sending out an email. Tinkering around with it, I decided I
                wanted mails that are sent to be at least a little bit different one from another. So in the database, I
                made a bunch of templates, making which was helped enormously by a great friend. Then the mails were
                sent through a Gmail account I had made exactly for that reason. With hindsight, there seems to have
                been a better way to do all of this but I made this and it worked so this is all that matters, I did it
                similar to this: <a
                    href="https://medium.com/@edigleyssonsilva/cloud-functions-for-firebase-sending-e-mail-1f2631d1022e">[link]</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then came security. I needed to ensure that no one could enter any other part of the database other than
                that which was designated for them. There is literally nothing here to say, I just followed the
                instructions on how to do it <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore">[link]</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                CSS was still needed and as I had a lackluster ability to write it, the design is simple yet I would say
                the website looks good, especially as I had limited myself almost exclusively to the color pallet of my
                school.
            </p>

            <p>
                Then, I just purchased a domain, <a href="http://drugamatching.com"> drugamatching.com </a>, which I
                then hosted through Firebase with minimal both efforts and costs.
            <p>
            </p>
            <b> Note: </b> I have since stopped using the domain, as it didn't warrant the price and it can now be
            found on <a href="http://drugamatching.sevcnikar.eu"> drugamatching.sevcnikar.eu </a>
            </p>
            <p>
                In the year that his is active, almost half the school had at some point signed in with their school's
                mail account, which as far as numbers go, is for a small school a relatively good deal. There were
                rather many matches made, the exact number of which I would not be able to tell. In the end, I hope
                someone found use in this.
            </p>

            <p>
                Uwu, have fun.
