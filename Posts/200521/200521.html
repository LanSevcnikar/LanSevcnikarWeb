        Remaking Castle Wolfenstain

      <p>
        I am a big fan of videogames. Yet, as a programmer, I have never
        really had the chance to build anything as I am much too big of a fan
        of building things from scratch. And real 3D engines, coupled with the
        physics engines are beyond the scope of one person to create,
        especially in a short time frame.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, I have decided to recreate the Wolfenstein engine, which due to
        its limitation to a 2d plane made for an interesting challenge while
        still allowing me to do everything from scratch, only calling onto
        library functions for drawing squares and lines.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        First, I created a playable map. An older version of this had, like
        previously in Ray casting, a bunch of lines which you could draw
        shapes with. But I realized that a much nicer method would be to
        represent every level as a .txt file, where '#' symbols would
        represent walls, '.' would represent the floor (where the player could
        walk) and a 'p' symbol would be where the player spawns in. So each
        map then has, in its first line specified its width and height in
        integers, followed by on which line the symbols '.' and '#'.
      </p>
      <img src="../../img/200521map.jpg" alt="Map"
        style="margin: auto; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />
      <p>
        I made the whole level a class. Within that class, we then add
        <code>this.player</code>, which will be another player. I defined his
        width as zero, as to prevent having to deal with many issues, so he is
        just a point.
      </p>
      <p>
        The player then got a position, a direction of looking and some other
        constants which would define its movement and rotation speeds. Then we
        add movement, for which we just check if a button is being pressed and
        if it is, we move accordingly. For collision, I also did not
        complicate much with collision. For every time the character wanted to
        move, I checked if the new position is inside of a wall. If it was,
        the movement direction was changed into the vertical and horizontal
        component and tried to move by those (as to allow sliding along the
        walls). (The constant distance is the distance x on the image belowand
        the angle is a - P is the player)
      </p>
      <p>
        Then I created a class called <code>Ray</code>. I then made an array
        of these and gave it to the Player object. All rays were then moved
        and rotated in accordance with the movement of the player.
      </p>
      <p>
        At first, all the rays were, to each other adjacent by the same,
        constant angle. But this then appeared to be the first of the three
        sources of the fisheye effect. The solution was then to imagine in
        front of the player a row of equally spaced points (somewhat
        resembling a screen) and shooting a ray though each. It is obvious
        that the more to the side we go, the bigger the distance will be
        between each two adjacent rays. Assuming the distance between each two
        "pixels" was to be x, the angle is then calculated as
        <code>atan(x) </code> (on image, the distance is d, the angle is a and
        the value we look - the adjustted distance - is b)
      </p>
      <img src="../../img/200521math.jpg" alt="math used"
        style="margin: auto; display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />
      <p>
        To actually make the 3D graphics work, we actually just show this 2D
        world. The changing of height is what actually gives us the illusion
        of depth. Each ray is responsible for one column for one portion of
        the screen (as there are 200 rays, 1 200th of it). The height of the
        colored pixels is determined as constant/adjusted distance. The
        constant is just gotten through experimentation until something looks
        right.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can play through two maps I made or try creating your own. The
        arrow keys on your keyboards will allow you to move around or if you
        are on a mobile device, the makeshift WASD keys will do that on the
        top of the screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the left, we see the top down view and what is actually there. All
        of the orange lines are individual rays. On the right is the view as
        it would be seen on a game console.
      </p>
