        Connecting famous actors
      </h1>
      <p>
        Recently, I was browsing TikTok, as I usually do, as I stumbled upon a <a
          href="https://www.tiktok.com/@saruuuuuuugh/video/6873657829337664773?sender_device=pc&sender_web_id=6767015900040447494&is_from_webapp=1">video</a>.
        It argued that any two actors in the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/list/ls058011111/">top 1000 actors list
        </a>by IMDBG could be connected to any other actor on that same list with 6 or fewer connections. This seemed
        to me trivial and wanted to lower that number down.
      </p>
      <p>
        How to do this is in theory simple. I get the names of all the actors and all the movies they played in and I
        represent them as a graph, where the actors are nodes and common movies, finding the shortest path amongst them.
        This is an unweighted graph, meaning that even the most simple of shortest path algorithms could do the
        job(BFS).
      </p>
      <p>
        First, we started by downloading the top 1000 actors and actresses. For that, a simple python script was done in
        a few minutes where I just downloaded 10 pages listing the actors.
      </p>
      <p>
        it turns out all actors are classified by a 7 digit code that defines them. It is also the link to their
        website. Delightful.
      </p>
      <p>
        this point, I would like to note that I am aware that saying all the actors is wrong and I should be using
        actors and actresses, however as I am writing this at 2 am, I must confess every second is valuable. This is
        1000 link I must scrap off od the internet, which takes a while. It takes approximately 0.33 seconds for my
        computer to get a response from IMDB after sending a request. Doing simple math, this would take a bit more than
        5 minutes. To speed the code up, I then decided I will parallelize it, making it all much quicker. How much.
        About 8 times quicker. At this point, the difference is not much but the difference will be huge in the next
        step.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had considered my job to be done and calculated the maximum degree of separation (largest amount of steps one
        might have to take), to be 4. However, seeing which movies were the connecting values, I decided that I needed
        to do another step.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem, you see, was that while everything was working on paper, it was connecting people on movies no one
        has ever heard of or movies that had never been released. I considered this to be dreadfully wrong as it was not
        fun to do. I wanted to connect people through known movies if those existed and through unknown movies, if those
        did not exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        To do so, I checked for every move two things. 1. if the movie had been released already. And 2. how many
        reviews did it have. I did this for all 85000 works I had collected before that which took a little bit less
        than 5 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point, I would like to say that I thought I fixed the problem that included TV shows as well, however
        after the almost 5 hours finished, it became apparent that that was not the case. I had already, I think, found
        the fix, however, I did not feel like spending 5 hours of my time to try and fix that small little annoyance.
      </p>
      <p>
        All it took then was to write some pretty HTML, Javascript and CSS to make for an appendable part to this
        website, or so I thought. But the thousands of movies, actors, their names, ranking and connections all added up
        to be multiple megabytes in size.
      </p>
      <p>
        So it was time to compress everything down. Step number one was to remove most of the movies. I looked at the
        most popular movie that connected any two actors. If a movie was not connecting any two actors as the most
        popular movie they both shared, I removed it from the memory. <br>
        I also reindexed everything, however, still, the biggest source of memory was the long names of movies,
        something
        I kept in a <code>translation dictonary</code>, so as not to have the adjacency matrix file too long.
      </p>
      <p>
        All in all, I was able to narrow it all down from a bit under 5 megabytes to about 4.5 kB. I know I could drop
        this down to about half that, however, this is now low enough that it no longer is an important part and further
        optimization would require too much trickery for it to be considered worthy. I could also compress the files
        using some algorithms, but again, at this size, it is no longer that important to do so.
      </p>
      <p><i>Enough talk, results</i></p>
      <p>
        As said before, the largest separation is 4 degrees. One of such examples are actors Ingrid Bergman (11) and
        Shah Rukh Khan (21). But most actors are connectable in two steps, especially of those that are popular in the
        current Hollywood scene.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only thing I would like to comment on. In the original Tik Tok, the creator tries to connect Alan Rickman
        and John Malkovitzh. It takes her 3 steps to do so and I would like you guys to try and see for yourself how
        many steps are really needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        All in all, a fun little project but the fact that 10 python scripts for either downloading something or joining
        downloaded data together as well as hundreds of downloaded files are currently sitting in that folder, I know
        that this was budged together and I am ashamed to submit any of the code.
      </p>
      <p><i>UwU, have fun</i></p>
