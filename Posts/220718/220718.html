        With great shame, I admit that I have been an active DM for a while now. Consequently, I have been surrounded by
        challenges and this was one of the bigger ones. As we play online, I needed a way to quickly draw maps as well
        as to with ease move characters around. I found the first half of that in <a
          href="https://dungeonscrawl.com">Dungeon Scrawl</a>, but I was disappointed by the lack of a few features. I
        wanted the ability to just move characters around as having a map by itself was not very useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Writing to the creator of the web app, hoping I could fork the features in, I was met with a very polite no. So,
        the only reasonable solution was to recreate everything they made and make my version of the app.
        And in about 4 days, I have now produced a painfully not effective app.
      </p>

      <p>
        There were a fair few problems when it came to building the app. The real problems consisted of:
      <ol>
        <li>Visualizing shapes to prevent overlap of their borders</li>
        <li>Figuring out the FOV of characters </li>
        <li>Hiding things, especially shapes, that are outside of the FOV</li>
      </ol>
      Of course, there were a lot of smaller problems, such as how to represent shapes, how to save and load states, and
      how to select items, just to name a few but realistically, it took little to no thinking to solve those smaller
      problems.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Visualizing shapes to prevent overlap of their borders
      </h3>
      <p>
        To create the field of all the shapes, I could just draw the shapes themselves into the canvas. However, their
        outlines had to be calculated if they lie on the border between the outside and the inside or if they are placed
        inside of another shape. Each shape is represented only by a collection of nodes, as to allow any shape to be
        made. But this, coupled with the fact the shapes are not limited to integer coordinates, meant that I had to
        find a general solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        The solution was simple. Each line of each shape on each layer was checked for any collisions with any other
        shape. I put all the points of collisions into an array, effectively breaking down the original line into a few
        segments that were all contained in their entirety (they were not passed through by any line).
        For each line segment after that, I just checked if the middle point was inside of any
        shape.
      </p>
      <p>
        To check if a point is inside of another shape, I used <a
          href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-check-if-a-given-point-lies-inside-a-polygon/">this solution</a>,
        where I imagined an infinitely long horizontal line. As with all code till now and from now, for the collision
        of two points, I made the most simple solution possible, calculating the linear function defined by the two
        points (unless vertical) and looking for the collision of the two linear functions.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Figuring out the FOV of characters
      </h3>
      <p>
        My first intuition was to recreate the method from Castle Wolfenstein, that I made years ago. However, there
        were two problems with such simple raycasting. It would be too slow and more importantly, it would not be
        precise enough for the bird view perspective. So I went with another solution that looking back was also equally
        slow but did produce a more accurate result.
      </p>
      <p>
        The solution was to connect each node of each shape to the player and then find the first
        intersection of that line with any shape. To that, I also added two other lines, rotated by a very minute angle,
        to capture the points behind walls. This by itself turned out to be very slow with large quantities of
        shapes, for which I partially blame Javascript and partially blame my ineffective code.
      </p>
      <p>
        This produced a solution but once again, the solution was very slow as I had to for each node calculate 3 lines,
        each of which was compared to each edge of each shape, producing a lot of necessary but slow calculations. While
        this is only calculated when needed and saved for later use, it is still slow. Although, the actual slowness is
        still a surprise to me as I think that O(v^2) should be much quicker, but this is JS that we talk about so I
        cannot complain.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Hiding things, especially shapes, that are outside of the FOV
      </h3>
      <p>
        This is by far the slowest part of the app. For each line segment that is drawn, I had to first segment it
        further to each character's FOV, after which I had to check for each item if the item is inside of
        some FOV. This is very slow when there are 40 or so shapes and I am very disappointed but as it does the job I
        need it to do, I am quite happy.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Conclusion
      </h3>
      <p>
        The app works well. However, it is not very user friendly as well as it is not very efficient. I am not sure why
        but it is good enough to leave the tool alone for a good while more. I plan on adding some more features to it
        but those will not be big features. I also recommend, if anyone would like to try this app, to make a lot of
        smaller maps and swap them around, as I do not plan on going into the vile code I wrote to make optimizations,
        as I do not deem it very needed and I want to move to projects that do not involve too much geometry as I think
        I have done more than enough of that.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also plan on adding another feature where you will be able to share the URL and the players will only see what
        they are supposed to see but this is going to be after making my personal server, which is the plan for the next
        project.
