      <p>
        With great shame I admit that I have been an active DM for a while now. Consequently, I have been surrounded by
        challenges and this was one of the bigger ones. As we play online, I needed a way to quickly draw maps as well
        as to with ease move characters around. I found the first half of that in <a
          href="https://dungeonscrawl.com">Dungeon Scrawl</a> , but I was disappointed by the lack of a few features. I
        really wanted the ability to just move characters around as having a map by itself was not very useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Writing to the creator of the web app, hoping I could fork the features in, I was met with a very polite no. So,
        the only reasonable solution was to recreate okay everything he made and make my own version of the app.
        And in about 4 days, I have now produced a painfully not effective app.
      </p>

      <p>
        There were a fair few problems when it came to building the app. The real problems consisted of:
      <ol>
        <li>Visualizing shapes to prevent overlap of their borders</li>
        <li>Figuring out the FOV of characters </li>
        <li>Hiding things, especially shapes, that are outside of the FOV</li>
      </ol>
      Of course there were a lot of smaller problems, such as how to represent shapes, how to save and load states and
      how to select items, just to name few but realistically, it took little to no thinking to solve those problems.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Visualizing shapes to prevent overlap of their borders
      </h3>
      <p>
      To create the field of all the shapes, I could just draw the shapes themselves into the canvas. However, their
      outlines had to be calculated if they lie on the border between the outside and the inside or if they are placed
      inside of another shape.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently, I was browsing TikTok, as I usually do, as I stumbled upon a <a
          href="https://www.tiktok.com/@saruuuuuuugh/video/6873657829337664773?sender_device=pc&sender_web_id=6767015900040447494&is_from_webapp=1">video</a>.
        It argued that any two actors in the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/list/ls058011111/">top 1000 actors list
        </a>by IMDBG could be connected to any other actor on that same list with 6 or fewer connections. This seemed
        to me trivial and wanted to lower that number down.
      </p>
      <p>
        All in all, a fun little project but the fact that 10 python scripts for either downloading something or joining
        downloaded data together as well as hundreds of downloaded files are currently sitting in that folder, I know
        that this was budged together and I am ashamed to submit any of the code.
      </p>
      <p><i>UwU, have fun</i></p>
