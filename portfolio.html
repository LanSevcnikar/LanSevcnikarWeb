        Any further questions can be answered via email (there are smaller competitions or projects that are not listed anywhere but would love to talk about them)

        </h3>
        <p>
            I have also spent a large portion of my time learning both data science and PyTorch. While the projects themselves are either standard (CNNs and image recognition)
            or smaller (school projects that do not warrant me spending time writing in the blog), I have a good understanding of the field.
            <br>
            I have had a multitude of subjects devoted distinctly to AI and Data processing so if given a chance, would love to show that more in person.
