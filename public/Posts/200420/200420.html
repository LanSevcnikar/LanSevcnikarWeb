        Ray tracing

      <p>
        The art of rendering starts by figuring out what a ray of light hits.
        But figuring out what a beam of light hits is more than just a simple
        question. And this question is crucial for rendering more or less
        everything, from animated movies to videogames.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first thing that we might think of doing is to try to calculate,
        for every line that would count as a collision, at what point (if at
        any) the collision would occur. If that would not happen, then we
        taken the closest point. This sounds like a good idea and is in fact
        perfect if the enviroments are simple. Yet, if we were to have
        millions of objects or if the objects would be of shapes for which we
        could not tell if a line intersected it or not, this would no loner be
        viable.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        SOLUTION
      </p>
      <p>
        Let us start at a point, which we shall denote P0. Then, let us
        calculate the radius r of a circle, with a center at P0, which will be
        the largest possible r, for which there is no object inside of the
        circumference. Let us then denote this as r0.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then let us chose the direction in which we want to move and in that
        direction for r0 units. We then have a new point, which we will denote
        P1. This point will then be the center for the new circle with radius
        r1, for which the same conditions will apply. We then repeat this
        untill one of the following happens:
      </p>
      <p>
        Either the values will start exploding towards infinity, as no object
        will stand in our way. Then we will know that the ray would hit
        nothing and that we can stop the search.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other option would be that the values start approaching 0, which
        means that some object had been hit. We can also stop the search
        there.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        This method, however, is still not rather quick. We will need to
        calculate the distance from a point to every object for every point so
        as the number of objects approaches a larger numbers, it becomes clear
        that this method no longer works. It also becomes self evident why ray
        tracing is rarely used in videogames or similar projects and is used
        only in rendering where we can take days or hours. To do it correctly,
        it becomes an incredibly slow task and so most computers struggle for
        days to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
        An example of this is how Pixar used to have to spend up to 30 hours
        on a single frame when developing its movies (Desiderio & Phillips,
        2020)
      </p>

      <br />
      <p>
        IMPLEMENTATION
      </p>
      <p>
        We will have every shape denoted as an array of points, which will know the x and y coordinates of each vertex.
        We can then easily calculate the minimum distance from any point to any shape by:
        <br>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Calculating the distance between the point and every vertex (using the Pythagorean theorem).
        </li>
        <li>
          Calculating the shortest distance between any point and any edge of the shape.
        </li>
      </ol>
      The second one is much harder and requires some rather complex math. Let us consider all edges as lines (so as to
      assume they go off to infinity) Then, using <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_from_a_point_to_a_line" style="color: black;">these quations</a> we
      find the shortest path. We then check if the point is in between the two vertices that define the line and we are
      all set. Of course, we had to get the equation of the line from the two points, but that math should be doable by
      a high schooler (just do not forget the edge case of vertical lines).
      </p>
      <p>
        Taking the minimum of all these values gives us the value for the minimal distance from any point to any shape.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Let us then consider the ray as a class. In it, we will store the starting position of the ray as well as the
        direction it is facing. Then recursively, we will calculate the shortest distance to all the shapes and then
        taking the smallest of that for all the shapes. Then, we just recursively repeat that for the new point, which
        we get by from the point into the direction the ray is facing by the value we got in the previous step.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the distance moved is very small, then we return the point at which we are, as this clearly is a wall. If the
        distance is huge, we return infinity, as we clearly started trailing off to it.
      </p>
